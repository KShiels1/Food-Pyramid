The Food Pyramid is a tool that shows how much of each food category people should eat for a healthy, balanced diet. The assignment is to create an interactive food diary that allows users to record the different food shelf details for a given day, and record the date. The food pyramid must be created using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript only, and must include interactive functionality such as indicating the number of items consumed for a particular shelf and buttons to increase and decrease the number of items on a shelf. The assignment must also follow specific design requirements, such as breaks between the red and orange shelves and no use of images to generate the basic Food Pyramid shelves.
